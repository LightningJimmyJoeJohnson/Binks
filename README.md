This program runs in the background with no visible window. It will play a loud sound clip of jar jar binks saying "Meesa" at random times.
You could probably play any .au file as long as it is called meesa.au or you change the name of the target file in the code. 



Honestly do whatever you want with this code I don't give shit. It's trash code for a trash program idea.
