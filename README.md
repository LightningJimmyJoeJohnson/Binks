For those of you who are to lazy to compile it or don't know how-

Inspired by this guys post-

This program creates a window with Jarjar Binks' face and runs a timer in the background. When this timer is done the program will play a loud sound clip of jar jar binks saying "Meesa" and then start a new timer. These timers continue running even when the widow is closed. The window is intend to be a distraction. 


Honestly do whatever you want with this program. Just don't blame me.
